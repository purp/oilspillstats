The use of the dispersant at the source of the leak represents a novel  approach to addressing the significant environmental threat posed by the  spill.\u00a0 Preliminary testing results indicate that subsea use of the  dispersant is effective at reducing the amount of oil from reaching the  surface \u2013 and can do so with the use of less dispersant than is needed  when the oil does reach the surface. This is an important step to reduce  the potential for damage from oil reaching fragile wetlands and coastal  areas.\u00a0 \u201cWe will continue our relentless efforts to secure the source of the  spill.\u00a0 In the meantime, we will employ every available technique we can  to minimize the environmental impact on coastal habitats, communities  and the marine ecosystem.\u00a0 This requires a responsible assessment of the  risks and benefits of specific tactics,\u201d said Coast Guard Admiral Thad  W. Allen, the national incident commander for the spill. \u201cBased on the scientific analysis of the EPA and NOAA and review by the  National Response Team, it has been determined that the use of  dispersants at the subsea source is the prudent and responsible action  to take along with other tactics including surface dispersant, skimming  and controlled burns.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"We believe that the underwater use of dispersants could lessen the  overall impact of the spill,\u201d said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson.  \u201cDispersants are not the silver bullet. They are used to move us towards  the lesser of two difficult environmental outcomes. Until the flow of  oil is stemmed, we must continue to take any responsible action that  will reduce the impact of the spill, and that is what we are doing.\u201d This course of action was decided upon with thorough evaluation and  consideration of many factors as well as consultation with stakeholders.  Because subsea use of dispersants is a novel approach, several tests  were done to determine if the dispersant would be effective in breaking  up the oil and helping to control the leaks. While BP pursues the use of subsea dispersants, the federal government  will require regular analysis of its effectiveness and impact on the  environment, water and air quality, and human health through a rigorous  monitoring program. EPA's directive to BP, including the monitoring plan  the company must adhere to in order to ensure the protection of the  environment and public health, is publicly available at www.epa.gov/bpspill/dispersants. \u00a0The federal government will work with caution and strong oversight and  reserves the right to discontinue the use of this dispersant method if  any negative impacts on the environment outweigh the benefits.","link":"http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com//go/doc/2931/551271/"},{"title":"*Correction* Public urged to report breaks in boom along the Gulf Coast","start":"2010-05-15T16:39:37Z","description":"*Updates have been highlighted*MOBILE, Ala. \u2013 Spill responders are asking today for the public\u2019s help in monitoring boom along the Gulf Coast.

The oil was stored on board the Discoverer Enterprise drill ship 5,000 feet above on the water's surface, and natural gas was burned through a flare system on board the ship.\u00a0 The test was halted temporarily when the tube was dislodged.\u00a0 While this is disappointing, it is not unexpected given the challenging operating environment. Technicians have fully inspected the system and have re-inserted the tool.  The tool is fashioned from a 4-inch pipe and is inserted into the leaking riser, from which the majority of the flow is coming. While not collecting all of the leaking oil, this tool is an important step in reducing the amount of oil being released into Gulf waters.  The procedure - never attempted before at such depths - involves inserting a 5-foot length of the specifically-designed tool into the end of the existing, damaged riser from where the oil and gas is leaking. In a procedure approved by federal agencies and the Federal On Scene Coordinator, methanol will also be flowed into the riser to help prevent the formation of gas crystals, known as hydrates.\u00a0 Gas and oil will then flow to the surface to the Discoverer Enterprise drillship. The Enterprise has the capability to separate the oil, gas and water mixture safely and eventually store or offload the recovered oil onto another vessel.","link":"http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com//go/doc/2931/551935/"},{"title":"The Ongoing Administration-Wide Response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill","start":"2010-05-16T23:23:22Z","description":"The Ongoing Administration-Wide Response to the Deepwater BP Oil SpillPrepared by the Joint Information Center UPDATED May 16, 2010 6 PM* For a full timeline of the Administration-wide response, visit the White House Blog.","link":"http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com//go/doc/2931/552115/"},{"title":"Statement from NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco on Ongoing Efforts to Monitor Subsea Impacts of the BP Oil Spill","start":"2010-05-17T19:03:15Z","description":"\"Media reports related to the research work conducted aboard the R/V Pelican included information that was misleading, premature and, in some cases, inaccurate.

Based on a thorough expert analysis, we believe that these six total projects, which will be constructed expeditiously in the areas most at risk for long-term impact by oil, will effectively stem potential damage to these fragile shorelines.After committing to providing Governor Jindal our determination within 24 hours of our meeting with local officials and environmental experts to discuss these projects yesterday, I notified him this afternoon. I reiterated to him that this administration will hold BP responsible for providing full payment for any strategy that will protect our valuable coastal communities from the impacts of their catastrophe.In addition, we are moving critical response assets across all the Gulf Coast states in preparation for potential near- and long-term oil impacts. In Alabama, the Coast Guard Cutter Cypress arrived in Mobile Bay today to protect Dauphin Island from the north and west. Tomorrow, we will commence a surge of boom to Alabama's Katrina Pass that will be positioned to create a funnel to collect oil that comes in with the tide. Additionally, we have deployed four coastal patrol boats to coordinate response in Alabama's coastal waters.Four helicopters are being deployed to the Alabama, Mississippi and Florida coast to provide surveillance information to help skimmers position their efforts strategically to collect the most oil threatening the shore possible.

The FPCP continues to monitor for signs of weathered-oil encroachment through various resources including the Sentry program and is coordinating surveillance efforts with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC).The plan, known as the \"Trigger Response\" plan is based on three phases: monitoring, surveying and responding. \u00a0A response will be triggered during any of these phases should weathered oil products be detected.* \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The FPCP is currently in the monitoring phase, indicating that no tar balls or other weathered oil products associated with the Deepwater Horizon have been located near the protective buffer area. \u00a0This buffer area is established approximately 94 miles off the coast of the Florida Peninsula and the Keys.* \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If NOAA's remote sensors indicate oil products are encroaching upon this buffer area, the next phase of the plan - the survey phase, will be initiated. \u00a0The survey phase involves pre-staging appropriate resources into areas with projected or potential impacts.* \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If oil products are found within the protective buffer area, the response phase will be initiated. \u00a0The response phase may consist of offshore, near shore and/or onshore recovery actions.Resources are presently in place, including Sentry vessels with scientific support aboard, to monitor the Loop Current and eddy. Regular aerial patrols occur over specific regions in the Gulf of Mexico, and an environmental team reviews satellite imagery, ocean currents and other data that helps track weathered oil that could potentially reach the Florida Peninsula coastline.\u00a0No oil products from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill have impacted the Florida Peninsula or Keys to date. \u00a0The near-term risk for the Florida Peninsula and Keys continues to remain low.For additional information, media may contact the FPCP Joint Information Center at 1-888-693-3003.","link":"http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com//go/doc/2931/682715/"},{"title":"Administration Sends Third Bill to BP","start":"2010-06-21T23:14:46Z","description":"\u00a0WASHINGTON\u00a0- The Obama Administration today sent a third bill for $51.4 million to BP and other responsible parties for response and recovery operations relating to the BP/Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.","link":"http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com//go/doc/2931/683903/"},{"title":"NOAA Expands Fishing Closed Area in Gulf of Mexico ","start":"2010-06-22T00:00:15Z","description":"WASHINGTON-- NOAA has expanded the closed fishing area in the Gulf of Mexico to include areas where the oil slick is moving beyond the current boundaries off of the Florida panhandle and due south of Mississippi.\u00a0","link":"http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com//go/doc/2931/684247/"},{"title":"Press Briefing by National Incident Commander June 21, 2010","start":"2010-06-22T00:03:00Z","description":"NEW ORLEANS -- Coast Guard Adm.
